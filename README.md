titanic data set and JN file for NCM

Hi Arthur, I hope this is sufficient, I streamlined a bit with the data, showed some descriptive statistics around the data, then moved to the sk learn parts. 
I learned a lot from doing this, as it forced me to go into the documentation quite a lot to make the charts and make sense of the data.
Let me know if you have any issues.
